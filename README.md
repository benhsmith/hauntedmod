# hauntedmod

**hauntedmod** adds ghosts of the creatures you kill in Minecraft. Whenever you kill a non-mob a "ghost" of the creature appears in the spot where the creature was killed. The ghost looks more or less like the deceased except that it's transparent. The ghost will follow you around and make you feel guilty. Over time a ghost becomes more and more transparent until it disappears completely. Ghosts do not (currently) attack you but they are officially mobs so they will keep you from sleeping at night. As they should, since how could you sleep with the ghost of the pig you killed earlier that day staring at you.

The code needs cleanup and the tests are insufficient. But version 0.1 has the basics and *is* working.
